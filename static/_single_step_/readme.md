# Single Step
The journey of a thousand miles begins with a *single step*.
This is the base master template for any new customer / project.

It contains a basic Journey json file and a theme.css which can be used to demo how a very basic site looks.

It can be cloned and then used to create their own question set / look and feel to quickly get them up and running.
